# CPE_301_Final-Project
Final project for CPE301

This is Hunter Donaldson's solo attempt at the CPE301 final project for the spring 2023 semester.
In its current state I have the stepper motor, LCD, water level sensor, and the temperature and humidity sensor working.
Currently not working is the DC motor which I am uncertain how to code using juse the UART functions.
I have set up the RTC according to a online souce I have found, but I do not know for certain if it works.
Also I currently have a complete circuit wired to the breadbaords and arduino pins.
Unfortunalty my stepper motor does not spin now. I think the gears inside broke,
but I promise the stepper motor is trying to move because I can feel in vibrate and hear it.

My code is not finished and there are a few components left to fully get running with the arduino,
But I plan to work on this more in the future because I want to see it fully funtional.
The circuit its self was easy for me to build, but coding is not my strong suit currently.
I learned a lot from this class this semester and I look forward to seeing what I can design using using what I have learned.
