# CPE_301_Final-Project
Final project for CPE301

This is Hunter Donaldson's solo attempt at the CPE301 final project for the spring 2023 semester.
In its current state I have the stepper motor, LCD, water level sensor, and the temperature and humidity sensor working.
Currently not working is the DC motor which I am uncertain how to code using juse the UART functions.
I have set up the RTC according to a online souce I have found, but I do not know for certain if it works.
Also I currently have a complete circuit wired to the breadbaords and arduino pins.
