# CPE_301_Final-Project
Final project for CPE301

This is Hunter Donaldson's solo attempt at the CPE301 final project for the spring 2023 semester.
In its current state I have the stepper motor, LCD, water level sensor, and the temperature and humidity sensor working.
Currently not working is the DC motor and the RTC.
